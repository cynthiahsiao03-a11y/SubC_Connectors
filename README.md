<h1> SUBC- Hull and Frame Connectors </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I designed custom parametric connectors to reduce hull flexing by securing the hull to a fixed structural frame. Their primary function was to constrain deformation and maintain geometric stability rather than carry significant structural loads.

The connectors were modeled in SolidWorks according to the exact interface dimensions of the frame and hull assemblies to ensure precise fit and alignment. Because structural strength was not the governing design factor, the geometry and shape were prioritized to control flex and maintain consistent spacing. As a result, the connectors were optimized with low infill during manufacturing to reduce material usage and weight while maintaining the required form and function.
